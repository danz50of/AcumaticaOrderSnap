**Summarizing build progress**

Iâ€™m thinking about how to structure the next parts of this summary. For test coverage, Iâ€™ll list out validated scenarios. The reconciliation part confirms data alignment with Acumatica and notes a flaw found in the report â€” but surprisingly no changes were needed in the delta logic. Then, for the build status, Iâ€™ll confirm the data looks good and the build is complete. The next steps seem to be on hold for now, with a note on monitoring snapshots and possible future enhancement features. Letâ€™s get this into the right format and finalize it.
# Checkpoint: Order Delta Tracker Logic â€“ v1.0.0

## ðŸ“Œ Tag

## 1. Classification Grid  

| Condition                                                                         | Classification         | Notes                                              |
|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Exists in current snapshot but not previous                                       | NewLine                | New order line added; always positive delta        |
| Missing in current OR status = Canceled                                           | DeletedLine            | Line removed or canceled; negative delta           |
| OpenQty drops to 0 (price unchanged, status unchanged)                             | FulfilledComplete      | Fully shipped                                      |
| OpenQty drops but stays > 0 (price unchanged, status unchanged)                    | FulfilledPartial       | Partially shipped                                  |
| Any other change (qty, price, status outside â€˜Canceledâ€™)                           | Modified               | True edit                                          |

## 2. Stored Procedure: `PopulateOrderDelta`

- **Modified**  
  Â­ Â­Inserts all qty/price/status edits, excluding canceled lines  
- **DeletedLine**  
  Â­ Â­Single INSERT for either missing lines or status = Canceled  
- **NewLine**  
  Â­ Â­Captures brand-new lines in current snapshot  
- **FulfilledComplete**  
  Â­ Â­OpenQty â†’ 0 with no status change  
- **FulfilledPartial**  
  Â­ Â­OpenQty drop (> 0) with no status change  
- **Snapshot Writebacks**  
  Â­ Â­Updates `OrderSnapshot.Notes` to match each classification  
- **Run Log**  
  Â­ Â­Starts and ends each run with success/failure timestamp  

---

## 3. Test Coverage  

- Scenario tests for NewLine, DeletedLine, Modified, FulfilledPartial, FulfilledComplete  
- Edge cases: single-line order cancellation, status flips to Back Order  
- Re-run for multiple snapshot dates to confirm zero duplicates  

---

## 4. Reconciliation Validation  

- Acumatica open-order total 15,460.23 vs. snapshot view 14,975.13  
- Discrepancy traced to a report flaw in Acumatica, not in delta logic  
- Totals now align; no code updates required  

---

## 5. Build Status  

- All classification logic implemented and tested  
- Stored procedure deployed and running without PK collisions  
- Data integrity verified against Acumatica exports  
- **Build Complete** at tag `v1.0.0-delta-tracker-complete`  

---

## 6. Next Steps (On Hold)  

- Monitor daily snapshots for unexpected anomalies  
- Plan enhancements: line-level drill-through view, dashboard legend  
- Revisit performance tuning if volume grows significantly
